        <h1>Letters of Recommendation</h1>
        <h2>Cynthia Yopp</h2>
        <p class="p1">Dear Application Committee,

<br><br>
            I’m writing to recommend Philip Lague for acceptance into your organization. I have worked with Philip in my role as an English Teacher at the Center for Technology, Essex during his senior year here at the Center. In that time, I have found that he has a strong desire to learn, create, and understand the world around him. He is also a very respectful and reflective person who is able to complete tasks both independently and within a group setting.
            <br><br>
            I am currently teaching Philip in our Integrated Literacy class connected to the Computer Animation and Web Design program, where we focus on career and technical literacy, as well as general English topics. I have seen Philip face challenges head on and rise to the occasion, succeeding and often exceeding expectations, all the while maintaining a positive and humorous attitude toward life and all its difficulties.
            <br><br>
            Philip’s strong work ethic, professionalism, and creative thinking will help to make him an invaluable member of any career or higher education he pursues. I’m incredibly pleased that I have had the opportunity to work with Philip in his time here at our school and know he will be able to accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
            <br><br>
            Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need additional information.
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,<br><br>
            Cynthia Yopp (they/them)<br><br>
            English and Literacy Instructor<br><br>

            To Whom it May Concern,<br><br>


            I have had the great pleasure of working with Philip Lague for the past two years in Algebra 2 and Precalculus. In the time that I have known Philip, he has exhibited an intuitive sense of pattern recognition, a strong understanding of self, and a genuine sense of humor. All of these attributes make Philip a great addition to the math classroom - he is open to making mistakes with good humor along the way to discovering true math generalizations.<br><br>


            I first met Philip last year in Algebra 2. He presented as a student with a relatively traditional background in math - aware of his grades and looking for a formula to use. He expressed having some bad experiences in math classes prior and demonstrated a fixed mindset of his abilities. In Algebra 2, our focus was on developing an understanding of math concepts through the connection of physical and algebraic models of real-life situations. While this approach was initially confusing, Philip showed a strong aptitude for developing sense and purpose in the equations and other generalizations we came to after exploring a large problem. The confusion now comes from more complex situations in Precalculus, but I can count on Philip seeing the patterns emerge over time. <br><br>


            In the math classroom, Philip is genuine in his understanding of himself. He is friendly and open to others in an introverted and accepting way. His humor helps build bridges; shows others it is ok to make light of what could otherwise be a frustrating situation; and provides a shared connection to the overall experience of a useful, supportive, and fun math class. He is honest with himself and others. He puts others at ease and makes learning enjoyable. Because of this, I highly recommend Philip as an ideal candidate for your higher education community. <br><br>

        Dear Mx. Blank,<br><br>
        
        I noticed on Indeed that you have an opening for a small 3D animation role. It seems that I would be a good fit for it. I am creative, reliable, and good at following instructions.<br><br>
        
        I have two years of experience in 3D animation at the Center for Technology, Essex. I have participated in the SkillsUSA animation competition at the state level.<br><br>
        
        In addition to that, I also have a variety of related skills, such as 3D modeling, VFX work, Video Editing and Audio Design. This would allow me to potentially help out the team in other aspects of the production if needed.<br><br>
        
        Thank you for your time. Please accept these attached links to my resume and my example portfolio pieces. I look forward to arranging an interview; you can reach me at plague@vt.ewsd.org<br><br>
        
        Sincerely,<br><br>
        
        Philip Lague<br><br>
