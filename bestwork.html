            <div class="imageLeft">
                <img src="/media/images/lagueFinalPin.jpg" alt="Vermont Pin for SkillsUSA Pin Design 2023" class="workImage">
                <p class="centerText">This is a design for a pin based off of Vermont that I created for the SkillsUSA Pin Design competition in 2022-2023. My idea for the pin was to make a snowglobe with a Vermont landscape inside. I added lots of small details like the falling snow and ski tracks. This was my first time using Adobe Illustrator, and I learned a lot through the process.</p>

            <div class="imageRight">
                <img src="media/images/lagueBowl.jpg" alt="Still Life Bowl" class="workImage">
                <p class="centerText">This is a still life drawing of a bowl. I was quite proud of this at the time I made it, as the shading and shape are very defined and realized. I'm not too much of a traditional artist, but this showed me that if I set myself to it I could still get it done well.</p>

            <h2>3D Art</h2>
            <div class="imageLeft">
                <img src="media/images/lagueForest.jpg" alt="A collection of low-polygon objects that would be seen in a forest." class="workImage">
                <p class="centerText">These are low-poly models of trees and other things you'd see in a forest. The polygon count is so that they would be optimized for use in other programs like Unreal Engine. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="imageRight">
                <img src="media/images/lagueReef.jpg" alt="Coral Reef" class="workImage">
                <p class="centerText">This is a coral reef for an animation project I created. I made the rocks with Blender's rock generation add-on, and some of the coral was made by a classmate. I added lots of the little kelps/weeds to help make it a bit more realistic and lived in.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Animation</h2>
            <div class="imageLeft">
                <video src="media/videos/lagueReef.mp4" controls></video>
                <p class="centerText">This is an animation project based in that coral reef. The fish were modeled by others, but rigged by me. I began by brainstorming an idea for the plot, and then I rigged and animated each scene seperately and edited them together in Adobe Premiere Pro. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="imageRight">
                <video src="media/videos/lagueAnimationTests.mp4" controls></video>
                <p class="centerText">This is a compilation of several animations used to display some animation techniques. The character used in the emotion animations was rigged by me, and of course all animations were my doing as well. I tried to exaggerate lots of the themes to make them more apparent.</p>

            <h2>Audio Design/Music</h2>
            <div class="imageLeft">
                <audio src="media/audios/lagueMusic.mp3" controls></audio>
                <p class="centerText">This was a quick song I made using Beepbox, a web-based music creation tool for chiptune or similar music. I gave myself 20 minutes to make this, and given it's fairly simple and loops i'm not too upset with it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="imageRight">
                <video src="media/videos/lagueOverwatch.mp4" controls></video>
                <p class="centerText">In this project, I did sound design over this trailer for Overwatch without ever having seen that trailer. The music is from the game, and the sound effects were sourced online and manipulated in Adobe Audition, and finally combined to the project in Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
            </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Effects</h2>
            <div class="imageLeft">
                <video src="media/videos/lagueStarWars.mp4" controls></video>
                <p class="centerText">This is a group project I worked on with 3 others in late 2023. I did around half of the light saber effects, using Adobe After Effects. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="imageRight">
                <video src="media/videos/lagueMotionTracking.mp4" controls></video>
                <p class="centerText">This was a practice of motion tracking in Adobe After Effects using some stock footage. I also made the circle, line and text appear in a visually appealing way.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Video Editing</h2>

                <p class="centerText">This video was made to cover some content released in an update for a game I play. It was one of the first times I really attempted to put together some more complex editing, and even though it's still fairly simple I'm pretty proud of how it turned up.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="imageRight">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZ_f9h8pRK8?si=fz5wj0YclC4MNL57" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p class="centerText">This is an announcement trailer for an event being held in my charity group, Roblox Speedrunning Events. I tried my best to sync the text to the music to make it feel a bit fresh and unique, and I think that worked out really well for me. </p>

            <h2>Web Design</h2>
