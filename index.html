                Throughout my life, I’ve learned so much in all sorts of different fields of work. Although it may seem nice, this has led me with a difficult choice of what I’m actually interested in doing for the rest of my life. I enjoy everything I’ve dedicated myself to, but there’s too much for me to pick from.
                <br><br>
                In my earlier years of living I was exposed to lots of different forms of media, and the one that always grabbed my attention most was video games. In fifth grade, I made very rudimentary games with little to no substance using Javascript and KhanAcademy tutorials. I quickly moved past this phase of my life, however, and didn’t consider the possibilities again until much later, when I considered and eventually decided on going to Center for Technology, Essex in Vermont. I attended the Computer Animation & Web Design program (CAWD), and during my time there I've developed several skills related and not related to the world of video games.
                <br><br>
                In my sophomore year of high school, I decided to take a risk, because school just wasn’t working for me at the time and I didn’t really think I had any other choice. I signed up to join the CAWD program at Center for Technology, Essex, and I was shocked and excited to see that I was excited. At the beginning of the first year, I was quite nervous, because I had little to no experience in what we were doing. However, I quickly learned that it was different from normal school, as I was there practically all day every day, which gave me the perfect opportunity to learn and express my newly found skills and interests. Each week, we also did a project that we chose, and I had some fun throughout the year brainstorming and putting together these projects. I didn’t have the best attendance due to medical reasons, but I didn’t ever struggle too bad to catch up to the rest of the class and learn what they had learned in my absence. In year 2 of CAWD, it was honestly an entirely different experience. Class felt a lot more laid back, and self-motivated, but still focused. I struggled a bit adjusting to this format, but overall I enjoyed it even more than the previous year. We also had a larger focus on group projects, which if I was present in class were a great way to work for a change. Throughout the entire program, I learned skills such as 3D Modeling and Animation, 2D Animation, Photography, Web Design, Game/Level Design, Sound Design, Hand-drawn art (Portraits, Still Life, Perspective, etc.), Visual Effects, Video Editing, and so much more. 
                <br><br>
                In CAWD, I’ve learned a lot about what it could be like to work in a job in one of these fields, and taught me how important it is to have good working traits. It’s been a goal of mine to get work in on time more, and over the last 2 years I’ve definitely made strides in doing this, and I know why it hasn’t worked out if it hasn’t at that time. I always arrive to class on time or earlier and stay working until the very last minute, because I like to get things started early and finish early so I can start early on the next thing.
                <br><br>
                As for what to go into as a career, I’ve heavily considered Game Design, as the principles of what makes a game not only fun but captivating for a player have interested me for a long time. I’ve also considered Sound Design, since I have been a musician for years and composition of sounds and music, especially applied to games, is something I’ve seen myself becoming drawn to as well. Even in projects where it isn’t necessarily required, I seem to always find a way to incorporate my talents in music and sound into it. I was also astonished by how enjoyable Web Design was while working on our unit for it in CAWD, and I ended up finishing as a Certified Web Designer Associate (CWDSA) through a WebProfessionals test we took at the end of the unit. In addition, in my spare time I’ve taken up video editing as a hobby, and it’s led me to really enjoying the process of creating content through a program such as Premiere Pro whenever I have the chance to. 
                <br><br>
                As a result of my varying interests and skills, it’s made deciding my future much more difficult. I know this is not an entirely unique experience for someone of my age, but it’s still hard to navigate nonetheless. Regardless, I’m better off than I could be if I had no aim, and I have a passable understanding of the field I’m planning to enter. I still have plenty of time to make that choice, and I’m eager to explore each path to the best of my ability to determine what really strikes my fancy.
